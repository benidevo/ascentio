# CV Generation Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add CV generation feature that creates tailored CVs based on user profile and job description. The CV will be generated as JSON, displayed in an editable format, and exportable as PDF.

## Final Status (2025-06-28) - COMPLETED ✅

### All Tasks Completed
1. ✅ **Backend - CV Response Model** - Added `GeneratedCV` struct in `internal/ai/models/responses.go`
2. ✅ **Backend - CV Generator Service** - Integrated into Gemini client at `internal/ai/llm/gemini/client.go`
3. ✅ **Backend - CV Prompt Template** - Created `internal/ai/prompts/cv_template.go`
4. ✅ **Backend - API Integration** - Added `GenerateCV()` method in `internal/job/services_ai.go`
5. ✅ **Backend - API Handler** - Added `GenerateCV()` handler in `internal/job/handlers.go`
6. ✅ **Backend - Route** - Added route `POST /jobs/:id/cv` in `internal/job/routes.go`
7. ✅ **Frontend - Job Details Update** - Added "Generate CV" button in `templates/job/details.html`
8. ✅ **Frontend - CV Display Template** - Created `templates/partials/cv_generator.html`
9. ✅ **Frontend - PDF Export** - Implemented using html2pdf.js library
10. ✅ **Frontend - Editable CV** - All sections are contenteditable
11. ✅ **Frontend - Section Management** - Users can delete and add custom sections
12. ✅ **Frontend - Responsive Design** - Mobile-optimized with proper spacing

### Key Deviations from Original Plan

1. **CV Generator Service**: Instead of creating a separate service file, we integrated the CV generation directly into the Gemini client for better consistency with existing patterns.

2. **PDF Generation**: Used html2pdf.js instead of PDF.js for simpler implementation and better formatting control.

3. **JSON Export**: Removed in favor of direct PDF download, as users found the preview redundant.

4. **Enhanced Features Added**:
   - Dynamic section management (add/delete sections)
   - Skills filtering based on job relevance
   - Proper date formatting (Month Year format)
   - Location styling with italics
   - Dark-themed modals consistent with app design
   - Optimized one-page layout

### Issues Resolved

1. **Profile Data Recognition**: 
   - Created dedicated CV generation functions separate from CV parsing
   - Fixed prompt data flow to ensure user profile is properly passed
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Data Fabrication**:
   - Implemented strict AI instructions to use only provided profile data
   - Added schema validation to prevent fictional data
   - Result: CV now uses actual user data (Benjamin Idewor)

3. **Formatting Issues**:
   - Skills section moved to top as requested
   - Work experience shows 4-5 bullet points for recent roles
   - Dates display as "Month Year" (e.g., "January 2023")
   - Company locations shown with em dash and italics
   - Education shows field of study

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Architecture
```
- Gemini Client: buildCVGenerationSystemInstruction(), getCVGenerationSchema()
- Job Service: GenerateCV() with full profile data logging
- Prompt Templates: Both basic and enhanced CV generation templates
- API Route: POST /jobs/:id/cv
```

#### Frontend Features
- **Editable Content**: All CV sections use contenteditable
- **Section Management**: Add/delete sections with proper modals
- **PDF Export**: One-click download with print-optimized CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with tablet/desktop enhancements
- **Consistent UI**: Dark theme matching the application design

### Success Metrics Achieved

✅ User can generate CV tailored to specific job
✅ CV uses actual profile data without fabrication
✅ All sections are editable in browser
✅ PDF download with professional formatting
✅ Clean, one-page layout optimized for ATS
✅ Skills filtered by job relevance
✅ Proper date and location formatting
✅ Section management (add/delete)
✅ Mobile-responsive design

### Lessons Learned

1. **AI Instruction Specificity**: Explicit, detailed instructions in system prompts are crucial for preventing data fabrication.

2. **Schema Design**: Properly structured schemas with clear descriptions guide AI behavior effectively.

3. **User Feedback Integration**: Iterative improvements based on user feedback (spacing, formatting, section order) significantly improved the final product.

4. **Simplicity Over Features**: Removing the preview function in favor of direct download simplified the user experience.

## Conclusion

The CV generation feature has been successfully implemented with enhancements beyond the original plan. Users can now generate professional, tailored CVs that accurately reflect their profile data, with full editing capabilities and clean PDF export.
