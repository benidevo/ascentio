   - Reframe basic responsibilities as achievements where possible
   - Highlight leadership, problem-solving, and impact even in non-leadership roles
   - Tailor descriptions to emphasize skills mentioned in the job posting
   - For each role, include 2-4 bullet points maximum

   - Each bullet point should be a complete sentence describing an achievement or responsibility

4. **Education**

   - ENHANCE and ELEVATE the presentation without crossing into dishonesty

7. **Format and Style**
   - Keep descriptions concise and impactful
   - Use consistent verb tenses (past for previous roles, present for current)
   - CRITICAL: Copy all dates EXACTLY as provided in the input - do not change date formats
   - Maintain professional tone throughout

8. **CRITICAL: Write Like a Human, Not AI**
   - NEVER use AI-sounding phrases or corporate buzzwords
   - BANNED PHRASES: "leverage", "utilize", "spearheaded", "orchestrated", "synergies", "cutting-edge", "innovative solutions", "dynamic", "passionate", "results-driven", "detail-oriented", "team player", "go-getter", "game-changer", "disruptive", "seamless", "robust", "scalable", "streamlined", "optimized", "enhanced", "facilitated", "collaborated with stakeholders"
   - AVOID: Overly flowery language, buzzword combinations, generic superlatives
   - USE: Simple, direct language that sounds like a real person wrote it
   - TEST: If it sounds like it came from a template or AI, rewrite it
   - Be specific and concrete rather than vague and generic
   - Use natural sentence structures, not corporate-speak
   - Write as if you're explaining your work to a colleague, not giving a presentation
